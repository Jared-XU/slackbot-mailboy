# Converstion Slackbot

## About

This is a codefest project, which sets up a slackbot who can monitor messages in a certain Slack channel and give responses.
You can also query this bot using a certain style of natual language since I've integrated [quepy](https://github.com/machinalis/quepy) here.
I hope this bot can be enhanced to understand more and communicate more.

Another function is that I created several endpoint for being consumed by some restfull front end.

## How to use it

If you want to launch the bot, enter quepy and build the docker image with a token arg.

If you want to launch the endpoint, build the docker image directly.
